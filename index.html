            <section class="bio">
              <p>In December 2017 I graduated from NJIT with a bachelors degree in IT. 
		 A few months later I accepted a job offer for an IT Support Analyst position at the headquarters of a retail company.
		      My role was a mix of helpdesk/desktop and network support. This was a great first position as I gained a lot of insight
		      into how IT functions for a large business with over 700 sites and thousands of employees. 
		      Unfortuantely a year later my department was dissolved and I found myself on the job search again.<br> 
		      With the skills I had learned I was able to find a position as an IT Specialist at a non-profit residential treatment center.
		      This role has been another great learning opportunity as it is smaller in scale; 1 main campus with 3 remote sites, and 350 emplyoees.
		      The IT department consists of only myself and my manager so I get to see everything from start to finish.
		</p>
		    
		    <p>
			<br>My goal is to become a network engineer. I am currently studying for the CCNA exam and hope to acheive
		    	it by February 2020.

              <p> I will begin by telling a little bit about myself. I am originally from Staten Island, NY, but I moved to New Jersey when I was seven and I have been here ever since. After completing high school I went to Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg, NJ because I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with my life. Initially I was taking classes for a respitory therapy program, then I switched to nursing, and I even thought about becoming a corrections officer. I don't remember exactly when but something just clicked in my mind and I realized I spend all day on my computer, I'm intelligent, I think logically, why don't I just go into the technology field? Afterwards I began taking IT courses eventually finishing my B.S. in IT from NJIT and I couldn't be happier with my decision.</p>
              
             <p> People who know me best would describe me as shy and mellow with a good sense of humor. My hobbies include reading, watching movies, practicing piano/guitar, or playing strategy games. Overall I consider myself a pretty well-rounded individual. I enjoy light exercise like jogging and calisthenics to counter the fact that I will spend all day sitting on my computer. I also love learning about history in addition to technology.</p>
